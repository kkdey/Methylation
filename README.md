# Methylation
This repository contains the R codes and all relevant files for the statistical analysis of Methylation Data

There are two branches I am maintaining here- one the"master" branch that will contain all the updated R codes of relevance

and the other being the "sub-master" branch which will house some R codes, some figures that are very relevant and at the 

same time some internally processed data files (derived from the actual data sets we have dealt with so far)..


The dataset we have investigated so far has been the GSE52865 dataset (the beta values are extracted from that dataset)

However we shall be looking at some more datasets and will try to modify the sub-master branch as we continue to do so
